# GeneralizedSparsitySolvers
Code for the paper "Generalized sparsity-promoting solvers for Bayesian inverse problems".

We provide the code for experiments as Python Jupyter notebooks. To set up your environment prior to running the code, the steps are:
1. Create a new conda environment with `conda create --name gensparse python=3.11.6`.
2. Install the submodule `jlinops` with `cd jlinops` and then `pip install -e .`.
3. Install other dependencies with `pip install requirements.txt`.
